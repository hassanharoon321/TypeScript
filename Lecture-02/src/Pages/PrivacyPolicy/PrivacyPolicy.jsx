        </p>
        <p>
          Please remember that if you post any of your personal information in
          public areas of CV Vlogs such as the searchable resume database, such
          information may be collected and used by others over whom we have no
          control. We are not responsible for the use made by third parties of
          information you post or otherwise make available in public areas of CV

        </p>
        <p>
          We use "cookies" to help personalize and maximize your online
          experience. A cookie is a text file that is placed on your hard drive
          by a Web page server. Cookies are not used to run programs or deliver
          viruses to your computer. Cookies are uniquely assigned to your
          computer, and can only be read by a Web server in the domain that
          issued the cookie to you.
        </p>
        <p>
          One of the primary purposes of cookies is to save you time. The
          purpose of a cookie is to tell the Web server that you have returned
          to a specific page. For example, if you personalize CV Vlogs pages, or
          register for services, a cookie helps us to recall your specific
          information (such as user name, password and preferences). Because of
          our use of cookies, we can deliver faster and more accurate results
          and a more personalized site experience. When you return to CV Vlogs,
          the information you previously provided can be retrieved, so you can
          easily use the features that you customized.
        </p>
        <p>
          You may have the ability to accept or decline cookies. Most Web
          browsers automatically accept cookies, but you can usually modify your
          browser setting to decline all cookies if you prefer. Alternatively,
          you may be able to modify your browser setting to notify you each time
          a cookie is tendered and permit you to accept or decline cookies on an
          individual basis. If you choose to decline cookies, however, that may
          hinder performance and negatively impact your experience on CV Vlogs
        </p>
        <p>Modification of Your Information</p>
        <p>
          You may review, correct, update or change your CV Vlogs account
          profile at any time on your 'My Settings' page or by emailing our
          webmaster at'support@Cvvlogs.com' or by calling customer support at
          (866)378-5647. These points of contact also allow you to edit your
          subscription to our newsletters and promotional emails. If you opted
          to receive job postings, commercial e-mails or other communications
          from CV Vlogs or third parties at the time you created a CV Vlogs
          account, but subsequently change your mind, you may opt-out by editing
          your CV Vlogs Account Profile as described above. If you previously
          opted not to receive such communications, you may later opt-in by
          editing your CV Vlogs Account Profile as well.
        </p>
        <p>
          We retain indefinitely all the information we gather about you in an
          effort to make your repeat use of CV Vlogs, practical, and relevant.
          Of course, you can delete your resume from CV Vlogs's online database
          and close your CV Vlogs account at any time by informing us via our
          feedback form. In such an event we will remove all our copies of your
          resume from CV Vlogs, your CV Vlogs account information and remove
          your profile, except for an archival copy which is not accessible on
          the Internet.

        <p>Security of the Profile Information</p>
        <p>
          We have implemented commercially reasonable technical and
          organizational measures designed to secure your personal information
          from accidental loss and from unauthorized access, use, alteration or
